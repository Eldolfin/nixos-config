evaluation warning: getExe: Package "kotlin-language-server-1.3.13" does not have the meta.mainProgram attribute. We'll assume that the main program has the same name for now, but this behavior is deprecated, because it leads to surprising errors when the assumption does not hold. If the package has a main program, please set `meta.mainProgram` in its definition to make this warning go away. Otherwise, if the package does not have a main program, or if you don't control its definition, use getExe' to specify the name to the program, such as lib.getExe' foo "bar".

evaluation warning: oscar profile: You have set either `nixpkgs.config` or `nixpkgs.overlays` while using `home-manager.useGlobalPkgs`.

evaluation warning: oscar profile: xdg-desktop-portal 1.17 reworked how portal implementations are loaded, you
                    should either set `xdg.portal.config` or `xdg.portal.configPackages`
                    to specify which portal backend to use for the requested interface.

                    https://github.com/flatpak/xdg-desktop-portal/blob/1.18.1/doc/portals.conf.rst.in

                    If you simply want to keep the behaviour in < 1.17, which uses the first
                    portal implementation found in lexicographical order, use the following:

                    xdg.portal.config.common.default = "*";
evaluation warning: You have set virtualisation.docker.enableNvidia. This option is deprecated, please set hardware.nvidia-container-toolkit.enable instead.
